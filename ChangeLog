	* src/instructions.h:
	* src/main.h:
	* src/parser.c:
	* src/parser.h: Compilation of the parse tree to the microcontroller
	memory is now supported.

	* src/parser.c:
	* src/parser.h: Converted the parser to use GErrors appropriately.

	* .bzrignore: Ignored a load of files.
	* src/instruction.c:
	* src/instruction.h:
	* src/instructions.h: Removed MCUSInstruction as a GObject and
	replaced it with a simple struct, private to the parser. Instructions
	will now canonically be represented as opcodes in memory.
	* src/parser.c:
	* src/parser.h: Work on the parser, which now theoretically supports
	instructions, operands and labels, although doesn't yet support
	subroutines or comments.
