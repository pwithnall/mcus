	* data/mcus.ui:
	* src/interface.c:
	* src/main-window.c:
	* src/main.c:
	* src/main.h:
	* src/simulation.c: Added more information to the sidebar, and allowed
	the clock speed to be changed when the simulation isn't running.

2008-05-23  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	* src/main-window.c: Slightly improved error handling when parsing,
	compiling or running a program.

	* data/mcus.ui:
	* src/interface.c:
	* src/interface.h:
	* src/main-window.c:
	* src/main.h: Added support for reading the ADC, and improved the
	interface a little.
	* src/simulation.c: Added simulation of some of the subroutines.

	* configure.ac:
	* data/mcus.ui:
	* src/Makefile.am: Changed the text editor to GtkSourceView.
	* src/instructions.h: Added an "END" instruction for simplicity's
	sake in determining when a simulation's ended.
	* src/interface.c:
	* src/interface.h:
	* src/main-window.c:
	* src/main.c:
	* src/main.h:
	* src/parser.c:
	* src/simulation.c:
	* src/simulation.h: Lots of work on the interface and simulation,
	and the interface now supports compilation and simulation of code
	entered into the editor. Simulations can be run, paused and stopped,
	and the input and output ports are now correctly handled, but the ADC
	isn't.

2008-05-21  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	* src/instructions.h:
	* src/main-window.c:
	* src/main.c:
	* src/main.h:
	* src/parser.c: Add support for subroutines and clean up code which
	determines instruction size a little.

2008-05-20  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	* src/main-window.c:
	* src/parser.c: Added support for parsing (and ignoring) comments,
	and updated the test program accordingly.

2008-05-20  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	* src/main-window.c:
	* src/main-window.h:
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* data/mcus.ui: Some initial work on a basic UI, as well as a small
	test program.
	* src/instructions.h:
	* src/main.c:
	* src/main.h:
	* src/parser.c:
	* src/parser.h: Fixes for small parser bugs and the introduction of
	simulation iteration. The system has now been tested with a few
	small programs, and so far seems to work through them properly.

2008-05-18  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	* .bzrignore: Ignored some more files.
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/instructions.h:
	* src/interface.c:
	* src/main.c:
	* src/main.h:
	* src/parser.c:
	* src/parser.h: Fixed build errors and warnings and the program
	now compiles.

2008-05-18  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	* src/instructions.h:
	* src/main.h:
	* src/parser.c:
	* src/parser.h: Compilation of the parse tree to the microcontroller
	memory is now supported.

2008-05-18  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	* src/parser.c:
	* src/parser.h: Converted the parser to use GErrors appropriately.

2008-05-18  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	* .bzrignore: Ignored a load of files.
	* src/instruction.c:
	* src/instruction.h:
	* src/instructions.h: Removed MCUSInstruction as a GObject and
	replaced it with a simple struct, private to the parser. Instructions
	will now canonically be represented as opcodes in memory.
	* src/parser.c:
	* src/parser.h: Work on the parser, which now theoretically supports
	instructions, operands and labels, although doesn't yet support
	subroutines or comments.

2008-05-17  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Initial commit.
