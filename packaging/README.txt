Installation
============

1) Extract the contents of the mcus-*.zip wherever you would like MCUS installed, making sure to keep it all inside the mcus-* folder (though you can rename this folder if you wish, e.g. to "MCUS").
2) If you aren't installing to "C:\Program Files\MCUS\" such that mcus.exe would be at "C:\Program Files\MCUS\lib\mcus.exe", you will need to edit windows.reg in a text editor to change all occurrences of this path to your installation location.
3) Double-click windows.reg to install the registry entries which will associate ".asm" files with MCUS.

Note that an automated Windows installer is available, and is recommended to be used unless installing on a network or via disk images.
